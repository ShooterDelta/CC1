I had some family emergency, hence I had very little time.
Thus I have made the app functional using command line arguments.

To add a blog: node app.js add --title="" --author="" --date="" --body=""
To read a blog: node app.js remove --title=""
To update a blog: node app.js update --title="" --body="new body"
To remove a blog: node app.js update --title=""

I will still be completing the app and will upload the changes if you guys please give me a little bit of time.
